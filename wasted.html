      <p>When I was born my mother took me to the zoo and dropped me into the gorilla enclosure, like with Harambe except instead of shooting the gorilla my mom just left. The zookeepers didn't notice. I was destined. After ten thousand techies game my brain has rotted away so much that it makes a fun sound when it sloshes around in my skull, but its so toxic it burn the top of the head that it doesnt touch much.</p>

        <p>P1 PLAYER WE GOT WWE SMACKTRICKZ STRAIGHT INTO AD2L AFTER LOSING FUCKING 1V1 WITH FENCE AND NEVER MENTALLY RECOVERING. ONLY PLAYER IVE EVER MET WHO HAD MORE DENT THAN HEAD</p>
        <p>Mid lane GOD GAMER Sa "Saulerino" al, I still have NO FUCKING IDEA why he agreed to play with this team and Im sure he wonders why every time we lose a game that SMACKDICKZ goes 1-15 as gyrocopter when 1500 mmr higher than the closest player on the other team</p>
        <p>After 2300 games with me who can say whether I made chen toxic or chen made me toxic, but the constant windchimes of bullshit sounds that come out of our lane surely makes our teammates toxic. Only wins when given a hero he hasnt played in AT LEAST 2 years and going a dogshit build that was last meta in the cretaceous period</p>
        <p>WASTER SAD & SUICIDAL player Clare was so cringed by LEGITMATE ESPORTS ORG WSS's attempt at existing that he asked all 4 of his friends to play under his new esports org WASTED SAD AND SUICIDAL (WSS), after all of them said no clare recruited the current enormous roster of shitters to round out the other wasted teams.</p>
